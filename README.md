# 🏛️ Devzarr — The Indie Bazaar for Developers

Welcome to **Devzarr**, a vibrant, open platform where indie developers showcase their freshest tools, gather around digital campfires, and amplify their launches with real community, not algorithms.

Devzarr is where software meets story—where you don’t just drop your repo and hope. You *spark* something. 💥

## 🌟 What is Devzarr?

> A developer-powered bazaar for discovering new tools, collaborating with kindred coders, and using AI to help market your project—openly, fairly, and with a little attitude.

### Core Values

* 💡 **Indie-first** — Devzarr is built for solo devs, small teams, and makers.
* 🧵 **Human connections** — Join “Cliques” (IRC-inspired rooms) for real-time talk.
* 🤖 **AI Assistants** — Generate launch threads, release notes, and blurbs in your voice.
* 🛍️ **No gatekeeping** — No downvotes, no karma games. Just signal.
* 🧠 **Open source** — Transparent, collaborative, and free to remix.

## ✨ MVP Features (in progress)

* 🧪 **Project Submissions** — Show off your tool with tags, media, and signals like "I’d Use This" or "I’m Using It Now."
* 🔎 **AI Search Assistant** — “Find me a browser extension that does X...”
* 💬 **Cliques** — Real-time, IRC-style chat rooms for dev tribes.
* 🚀 **Signal Boosters** — Contributor-only AI tools to improve your pitch, tagline, and social copy.
* 🎯 **Discover & Support** — Users browse by tags, vibe, or suggestion and can donate or contribute.
